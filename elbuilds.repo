# The mirror system uses the connecting IP address of the client and the
# update status of each mirror to pick mirrors that are updated to and
# geographically close to the client.  You should use this for Enterprise Linux
# updates unless you are manually picking other mirrors.
#
# If the baseurl=http:// does not work for you, as a fall back you can try the
# remarked out baseurl=ftp:// line instead.
